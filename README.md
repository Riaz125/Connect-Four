# Connect-Four

Connect Four is a game where each player is trying to get four consecutive slots of the board filled in order to win. The consecutive slots can be filled diagonally, horizantally, or vertically to count as a winning combo. Each player has a different color in order to indicate who's slot is filled; player one is black and player two is gray. If the entire board is filled without a winner then the game ends in a tie.
